            <p>Lights, Camera, Analysis! Roll out the red carpet, because we're diving into the world of movies, where popcorn isn't the only thing popping â€“ so are economic trends! Ever wondered if classic blockbusters like "Gone with the Wind" would give modern marvels a run for their money if we time-travel their earnings to today? Spoiler alert: when you toss inflation into the mix, some oldies might just top the charts. Zooming out, our world's economic rollercoaster seems to have a VIP seat for the movie industry. Does a country's wallet size, measured in GDP, dictate if its films will be box office hits or misses? Interestingly, this cinematic puzzle might have more twists than a thriller movie! Grab your 3D glasses, as we embark on this data-driven adventure, blending the art of cinema with the science of analysis!</p>
